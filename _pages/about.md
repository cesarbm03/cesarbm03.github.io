I finished my PhD in Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/fr">University of Ottawa</a> under the supervision of 
<a href="http://www.normalesup.org/~henry/">Simon Henry</a>. My research interests include;
 <ul>
  <li>(Synthetic) Higher categories</li>
  <li>Model categories</li>
  <li>Univalent Foundations and type theories</li>
  <li>(Synthetic) Higher algebra</li>
</ul> 
Check out the 32th edition of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/fmcs-ottawa">Foundational Methods in Computers Science</a> co-organized with <a href="https://richardblute.ca/">Rick Blute</a> held in Ottawa from June 17-June 20, 2025. Lookforward to future editions!

I collaborate in a formalization project of synthetic ∞-categories. We work with the computer proof assistant <a href="https://github.com/rzk-lang/rzk">rzk</a> developed by <a href="https://fizruk.github.io/">Nikolai Kudazov</a>.
