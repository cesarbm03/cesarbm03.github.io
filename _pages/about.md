I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/fr">University of Ottawa</a> under the supervision of 
<a href="http://www.normalesup.org/~henry/">Simon Henry</a>. My research interest revolve around the following topics:
 <ul>
  <li>Higher categories</li>
  <li>Model categories</li>
  <li>Univalent Foundations and type theories</li>
  <li>Higher algebra</li>
</ul> 
This summer, I co-organize with Rick Blute the 32th edition of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/fmcs-ottawa">Foundational Methods in Computers Science.</a>

I collaborate in a formalization project of synthetic âˆž-categories. We work with the computer proof assistant <a href="https://github.com/rzk-lang/rzk">rzk</a> developed by <a href="https://fizruk.github.io/">Nikolai Kudazov</a>.
