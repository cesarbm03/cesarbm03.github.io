excerpt: 'We explore a beautiful and intriguing relation between logic and homotopy theory. In this joint work with Simon Henry, we build the notion of a language over a model category. Throughout it, we hope to get some insights about models of infinity categories. The paper is still work in progress, but it is close to its final version.'

 We explore a beautiful and intriguing relation between logic and homotopy theory. In this joint work with Simon Henry, we build the notion of a language over a model category. Throughout it, we hope to get some insights about models of infinity categories. The paper is still work in progress, but it is close to its final version.
