 We explore a beautiful and intriguing relation between logic and homotopy theory. In this joint work with Simon Henry, we build the notion of a language over a model category. Throughout it, we hope to get some insights about models of infinity categories. The paper is out on arxiv! <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02607">https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02607</a>
